# my-Cuckoo-reports
This is where I put my cuckoo sandbox analysis reports.

## web interface browsing usage
In order to browse the analysis results as you would do in the cuckoo web interface, download the repo start a webserver in the malware directory and open http://localhost:port in your browser.
The commands will look something like this:
`git clone https://github.com/Ily455/my-Cuckoo-reports.git
cd my-Cuckoo-reports
python3 -m http.server -b 127.0.0.1 8080`
